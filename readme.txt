1) Task is written in task.txt.
2) Pull this project and run npm install, it will install all the dependencies required.
3) Now run the project by node bin/www
4) Now this will scrape medium.com and gets all the link on this page.
5) I have used async.js and limited the parallel requests to 5 using async.q.
6) Once it crawls 'medium.com', i have used cheerio to find all the anchor tags from the html response.
7) Then i crawled all the generated anchor tags, to get further more anchor tags.
8) 'I HAVE LIMITED THE CRAWLING TO ONE LEVEL OTHERWISE THE CODE TAKES 1-2 HOUR TO GET ALL THE ANCHOR TAGS FROM THIS SITE.'
9) After this i filtered the overall all anchor tags array, and generated the report in file.csv.
10) Once the process ends, the server responds 'CSV Report Generated' on client side.
11) You can see the file is generated in your directory.
12) Please let me know if you have any query.
